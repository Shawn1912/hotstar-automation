# hotstar-automation
Automated login and play a series right from where you stopped watching in Hotstar video streaming website at 7 PM daily.

Used Selenium, Python3 and Google Chrome browser driver.

#### Scheduling :
For the script to run daily at 7 PM, I created a batch file (.bat) and added it to the Windows 10 Task Scheduler.
